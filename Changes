     ProhibitCallsToUndeclaredSubs is now configurable to exempt specific
     packages and subroutines.  See docs for details.

     Added support for blocks-of-constants in ProhibitCallsToUndeclaredSubs.
     For example: use constant {FOO => 1, BAR => 2);

     RequireExplicitInclusion now considers all "include" statements.  So
     a conditional or lexical "require" will now satisfy the policy, even
     if that condition is never satisfied during run-time, or the package
     is included in the wrong scope.

     Refactored common code into the StricterSubs::Utils module.

     Eliminated certain flavors of false-positives in several Policies.

     Improved caching gives performance boost when analyzing many files.

     Documented diagnostic messages.

     Now requires Perl-Critic-1.052+
